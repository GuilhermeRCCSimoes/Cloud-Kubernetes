Steps to Add HTTP/HTTPS Support

    Ingress Configuration:
        The odoo-ingress.yaml file in your k8s/ folder is responsible for configuring HTTP and HTTPS access.

    TLS (HTTPS) Certificates:
        You will need to generate or provide a TLS certificate for HTTPS support.
        If you're working locally, use a self-signed certificate, or use tools like Cert-Manager or Let's Encrypt for automatic certificate management.

    DNS or /etc/hosts:
        For local testing, add an entry in your /etc/hosts file to map the domain (e.g., odoo.local) to your Minikube IP address.

Updated Ingress File (odoo-ingress.yaml)

This YAML file sets up both HTTP and HTTPS for your Odoo application:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: odoo-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-staging"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: odoo.local
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: odoo-service
            port:
              number: 8069
  tls:
  - hosts:
